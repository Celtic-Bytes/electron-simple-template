# How to contribute ðŸš€

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

Before contributing, please read this document completely. If it's youre first pull request, you can learn from this [free video series](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
If you decide to fix an issue, please be sure to check the comment thread in case somebody is already working on a fix. If nobody is working on it at the moment, please leave a comment stating that you intend to work on it so other people donâ€™t accidentally duplicate your effort.

If somebody claims an issue but doesnâ€™t follow up for more than two weeks, itâ€™s fine to take it over but you should still leave a comment.

## Code of conduct

We has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere to it. Please read the [full text](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what actions will and will not be tolerated.

## Open Development

All work on React happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com). Both core team members and external contributors send pull requests which go through the same review process.

To â€‹â€‹see the available tasks you have 2 options:

- Check the Github [issues](https://github.com/Celtic-Bytes/electron-simple-template/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20label%3Aenhancement) and filter by label `enhancement`.
- Check the Github [project page](https://github.com/users/Celtic-Bytes/projects/1/views/1).

## Semantic Versioning

This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). We release patch versions for critical bugfixes, minor versions for new features or non-essential changes, and major versions for any breaking changes. When we make breaking changes, we also introduce deprecation warnings in a minor version so that our users learn about the upcoming changes and migrate their code in advance. Learn more about our commitment to stability and incremental migration in our versioning policy.

Every significant change is documented in the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Branch Organization

Submit all changes to the `develop` branch. Changes will be merged into the `main` branch after being reviewed and accepted.

Code that lands in `develop` must be compatible with the latest stable release. It may contain additional features, but no breaking changes. We should be able to release a new minor version from the tip of main at any time.

## Bugs

We are using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Celtic-Bytes/electron-simple-template/issues) for our public bugs. We keep a close eye on this and try to make it clear when we have an internal fix in progress. Before filing a new task, try to make sure your problem doesnâ€™t already exist.

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a reduced test case.

## License

By contributing to React, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same [license](./LICENSE) of this project.
